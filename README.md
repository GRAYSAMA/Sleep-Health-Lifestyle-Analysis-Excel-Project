# Sleep-Health-Lifestyle-Analysis-Excel-Project

This project explores how age, gender, BMI, and lifestyle factors such as stress, physical activity, and sleep quality interact to impact health. Using Excel's data analysis and visualization capabilities, I cleaned, transformed, and visualized a dataset sourced from Kaggle to uncover trends — especially focusing on **BMI distribution across different age groups and genders**.

## 📊 Project Overview

### ✅ Data Source

- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## 📈 Key Pivot Tables & Analysis

### 1. Age Bracket vs BMI Category

- Shows the number of people in each age group who fall into Normal, Overweight, or Obese BMI categories  
- Helps visualize general health patterns across life stages  

### 2. Age Bracket + BMI Category + Gender

- Designed to highlight how **women aged 40+** (menopausal group) show increased rates of being overweight or obese  
- Supports scientific claims about hormonal and metabolic changes post-menopause

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard

The dashboard is fully interactive using Excel **PivotTables** and **Slicers**.  
It includes **4 slicers** connected to both pivot tables for dynamic filtering:

- Gender  
- Physical Activity Level  
- Stress Level  
- Quality of Sleep  

These slicers allow users to gain tailored insights based on specific demographics and lifestyle habits.
